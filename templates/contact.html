As writers ourselves, we want to give other writers a hand and aid them in their journey to creating the next bestseller. So we’ve created this comprehensive guide to help you get the best experience out of our site. Let’s dive right in!</p>
<h4>Features Of Our Word Counter</h4>
<p>The word count tool is fairly easy to use. You can directly type your text into the box. Or if you’re using a word processor or online tool, such as Google Documents, to write your piece, you can simply copy and paste it onto the text box.
Now the word count tool is more than just a simple word counter. It actually has a lot to offer. And we’ll be tackling each cool feature according to sections.</p>
<h4>How To Customize Text On Word Count Tool?</h4>
<p>Once you’re on the homepage, you will immediately see the text box in the middle of the page. This is where you’ll be placing your text. Right above the text box, you will see four tabs. The first tab will allow you to choose from a variety of fonts. Right next to that tab is the Size tab. From the name alone, you can already guess what that tab does. The font sizes available for use are in the range of 10 to 14. Now, these two, so far, are pretty basic, and you can find them in most word processors. But the next tab is pretty cool. The third tab, labeled Case, allows you to alter the letter case of the text. The default setting is sentence form wherein the start of each sentence is in uppercase. But you can also change the text to all lower case and all upper case. There’s also another option that makes the text into a title. Lastly, there’s the clear tab that allows you to erase the entire text box and start with a fresh, blank one.</p>
<h4>Counters On Word Count Tool</h4>
<p>Above the tabs, you can see five boxes with their respective labels. These are the counters. As you’d probably expect, the first box will show you the word count for the text pasted. The next two boxes feature the text’s character count, one putting into account spaces and the other without. To the right of that, you will have the sentence count. Now, you should note that the sentence counter determines a sentence by the presence of an end punctuation. So if let’s say, you copy and paste an article with all the headings present, the site will not count those as sentences. It will consider the heading and the first line for that section as one sentence. Additionally, if no end punctuation is present in the entire text, the counter will display a count of one instead of zero in the sentence counter. Lastly, you will find the paragraph count. How it works is that it will identify a chunk of text as a paragraph through the presence of breaks in between texts.</p>
<h4>Word Frequency Counter</h4>
<p>Moving to the right of the text box, you will see the Word Frequency Counter. This incorporates a fun little way of playing around with data. The Word Frequency Counter basically lists down all the words used in the text and counts how many times they appeared and what percent of the text they comprise. Now, why do you even need to know this data? Well, aside from telling you what words you commonly use in your writing style, it can also be helpful for SEO purposes. It’ll show you how many times you’ve mentioned certain keywords in your text. This way, you can determine whether your use of keywords in the article was overkill or not enough. And of course, you can adjust accordingly to better optimize your work.</p>
<h4>Flesch Reading Score And Text Readability</h4>
<p>Now, looking at the bottom part, you will see two lines right below the text box. The first line is labeled Flesch Reading Score, while the second is labeled Reading time. As you can probably tell, the reading time will give you an estimate of how long it would take for an average person to read through the text. This is an especially nice feature to have when writing a speech since you often can’t tell how long it already is until you practice reciting it out loud. Having this feature will help save you time while still constructing your speech so you can cut or add accordingly. Another thing that could affect reading time is readability. The Flesch Reading Ease is just the tool to help you determine that. The test uses a formula to assign a score to a particular text depending on the number of words, sentences, and syllables in your work. But to put it simply, the higher the Flesch Reading Score, the easier it is to read.</p>
<h4>Word Count Per Page Converter</h4>
<p>Lastly, take a look below the Flesch Reading Score and Reading time. You will find the Word Count Per Page Converter. This will allow you to know the total number of pages your article occupies based on the font and spacing you’ll be using, and of course, the word count. This little tool is perfect for assignments where your instructor just requires minimum or maximum pages.</p>
